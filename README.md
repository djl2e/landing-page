TOP Flexbox Project  
  
For TOP's Landing Page project, I created a main homepage for a fake basketball academy. In this page, I showcase my newly obtained flexbox skills - placing contents in their appropriate positions. Moreover, I further displayed my honed css skills. I took extra time to add hover effects on links and images and added a fixed background image to make the page more visually appealing.
